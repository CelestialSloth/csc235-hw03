# How to Produce Visualizations
## Length of Stay vs Entry Timestamp
This visualization shows the difference between the first and last timestamps recorded for each vehicle id over time. To generate it, run all code in ```car-stay-length.ipynb``` and view the visualization produced by the last cell. (Note that one of the cells takes about three minutes to run.)

## Average Chemical Readings for Sensor 6 on Days with W Winds
Run all code in ```kasios.ipynb``` and view the visualization produced by the last cell. (Note that one of the cells takes about three minutes to run.)

## Average Chemical Readings for Sensor 9 on Days with SW Winds
Run all code in ```radiance.ipynb``` and view the visualization produced by the last cell. (Note that one of the cells takes about three minutes to run.)
